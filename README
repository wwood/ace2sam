To compile:

  gcc -g -O2 -Wall -o ace2sam ace2sam.c -lz

To run:

  ace2sam in.ace > a2s.out 2> a2s.err
  (grep ^H a2s.err | sed s,^..,,; cat a2s.out) > a2s.sam
  grep ^S a2s.err | sed s,^..,, > a2s.fa

The immediate output of ace2sam is a SAM without header. Ace2sam works on a
stream. It is unable to write the SAM header until it sees all the contigs.

Assumptions about ACE:

 * Fields appear in the following order: AS->(CO->[BQ]->(AF)->(RD->QA)).

 * The order of reads in AF is identical to the order in RD.

 * Words and numbers are separated by a single space or TAB.

 * Each line ends with '\n', not '\r' or '\r\n'.
